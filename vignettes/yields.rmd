## Quickstart ##

This is a short document on getting up to speed with `GBcurves` quickly.

## Downloading dataset ##

Version 0.1.6 of `GBcurves` makes it possible to download yield curves of Brazil, China, and Russia. The data comprises daily observed yields per maturities. It interpolates with `smooth.spline` function for unavailable maturities for Brazil only.

### Example

Here's an example of usage that will download yield curves of Brazil:

```{r notrun, eval=FALSE}
library(GBcurves)
init <- "2020-05-11" # YYYY-MM-DD
fin <- "2020-05-17" # YYYY-MM-DD
mty <- c(3,6,12,120,360) # must be in months
ctry <- "BR"
df.out <- yields(init = init,
                 fin = fin,
                 mty = mty,
                 ctry = ctry)
```

### Brazil (BR)

The database consists of a panel of daily time series of zero yields from the closing prices of the future interbank deposit (future DI) from the [B3 - Brazil Stock Exchange and Over-the-Counter Market](https://www.b3.com.br/). 

The DI rate is the average daily rate of Brazilian interbank deposits (borrowing/lending), calculated by the Clearinghouse for Custody and Settlements (CETIP) for all business days.  The DI rate is expressed in annually compounded terms, based on 252 business days.

In  general,  there  are  around  20  maturities  with  authorized  contracts  every  day,  but  not all of them have liquidity. The ID futures curve is generated by interpolation of the ID futures settlement prices.

### China (CN)

The database consists of a panel of daily time series of ChinaBond Government Bond Yield Curve (YTM), values (% per annum).

The available maturities (in months) are `(0.96, 2.04, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, 600)`.

### Russia (RU)

The database consists of a panel of daily time series of [Russian government bond zero-coupon yield curve](https://www.cbr.ru/), values (% per annum).

The available maturities (in months) are `(3,6,9,12,24,36,60,84,120,180,240,360)`.
